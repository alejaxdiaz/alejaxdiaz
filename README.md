# Hi there, I'm Ale

I know a bit of everything (jack of all trades), just enough to make my ideas come alive (master of none).

I build small experiments, automate my life, and follow curiosity more than tutorials.

I like fantasy, sci-fi, nordic mythology, and crows — which somehow always sneak into my projects (along with galaxy themes)

If you’re into cozy chaos, tiny prototypes, and building things just because they feel cool, we’re already friends.
