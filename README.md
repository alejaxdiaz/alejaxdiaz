# Hi there, I'm Alejandra Diaz! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a 28-year-old JavaScript enthusiast and a passionate student of technology. I'm currently venturing into the realms of web and game development and every day is a new journey of learning and discovery for me. ðŸš€

When I'm not busy coding, you can find me immersed in the world of fantasy, exploring Nordic mythology, and marveling at the endless possibilities of sci-fi. The intricate narratives, complex characters, and the idea of parallel realities are what captivate me the most about these genres. ðŸ“š

Oh, and did I mention I love crows? They're the most intelligent birds out there, and there's something incredibly mystical about them. ðŸ–¤

## What I'm Currently Learning
I'm deep diving into JavaScript and Godot, honing my skills and understanding of the language. I'm all set to explore its application in web and game development. My aim is to create dynamic, user-friendly websites and fun, immersive games.

## What I Aim to Achieve
The tech world is an ever-evolving landscape, and I am here to grow with it. I aim to contribute to this exciting industry by creating products that make a difference, and I'm excited for all the projects and collaborations on the horizon.

## How to Reach Me
Feel free to connect with me here on GitHub, or reach out to me on Discord > alezard if you want to talk!

## Until then, happy coding! ðŸ’»
